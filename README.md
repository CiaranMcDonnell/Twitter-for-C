## Notes
The majority of work on this document was made using the Live Share feature on Visual Studio Code on Discord Calls.
This improved our productivity and allows us to work on problems collaboratively however with the downside of less accurate commit history changes.
As due to this all of the commits history would be credited to the Live Share host.
