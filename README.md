Once you've done this, the program will run for you in full and you can experience the interactive experience that is Twitter for C!

If you would like to compile this program yourself use this command for gcc
```gcc main.c account.c u_int.c feed.c -o ./twitter``` This will create an executable. In this example the term twitter can be named whatever you would like
